# Exercise 1.3

With applicative-order evaluation, Ben will get an infinite loop that will eventually cause the process to error. This is because the parameters of the procedure call will be evaluated first, leading to the execution of the recursive procedure `p` without a base case. 

When using normal-order evaluation, a value will be returned: `0`. This is because normal-order evaluation will 'fully expand, then reduce' parameters in a procedure. Therefore, the ill conditioned function `p` is never called, since the control flow of the procedure bypasses it entirely.
